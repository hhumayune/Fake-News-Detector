# Fake-News-Detector
Fake News Detection using a LSTM based Deep Learning Approach.
# Introduction
Fake News is pervasive nowadays and is too easy to spread with social media and it is difficult for us to identify. Since the Covid-19 outbreak in Taiwan recently, a lot of fake news has popped up on social networks, such as LINE, Facebook, PTT (one of the largest online forums in Taiwan), etc. Hence, we aim to utilize multiple artificial intelligence algorithms to detect fake news to help people recognize it.
# Related Work
In this section, we discuss some previous work that is related to fake news detection. Fake news can be defined as fabricated information that mimics news media content in form but not in organizational process or intent [1].  
	In recent years, a lot of automated fake news detection methods have been proposed. For example, Shu, Kai, et al. [2] provided numerous methods to solve the problem of fake news classification, such as user-based, knowledge-based, social network-based, style-based methods, etc. Julio, et al. [3] presented a new set of features and measured the prediction performance of current approaches and features for automatic detection of fake news. Daniel, et al. [4] focused on the analysis of information credibility on Twitter. Heejung, et al. [5] applied the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers model (BERT) model to detect fake news by analyzing the relationship between the headline and the body text of news.  
	Mohammad Hadi, et al. [6] applied different levels of n-grams for feature extraction based on the ISOT fake news dataset. Saqib, et al. [7] proposed an ensemble classification model for the detection of fake news that has achieved a better accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art also on the ISOT fake news dataset. Sebastian, et al. [8] used a neural network-based approach to perform text analysis and fake news detection on ISOT fake news dataset as well.
# Methodology
The process of fake news detection can be divided into four stages - data preprocessing, word embedding, models, and model fine-tuning.
## The Dataset
Link: https://www.uvic.ca/engineering/ece/isot/datasets/fake-news/index.php

The dataset we use is the ISOT Fake News dataset introduced by ISOT Research Lab at University of Victoria in Canada [9]. This dataset is a compilation of several thousand fake news and truthful articles, obtained from different legitimate news sites and sites flagged as unreliable by Politifact.com.
To get insight into this dataset, we visualized it with word clouds for real and fake news respectively. Figure 1(a). shows the word cloud of the real news in the dataset, and Figure 1(b). shows the one of the fake news in the dataset.

###### Figure 1(a).

###### Figure 1(b).

We can see that, in the real news word cloud, ‘Trump’, ‘say’, ‘Russia’, ‘House’, ‘North’, and Korea’ appeared frequently; while in fake news one, ‘VIDEO’, ‘Trump’, ‘Obama’, ‘WATCH’, and ‘Hillary’ appeared the most frequently. ‘Say’ appears frequently in real news but does not in fake news. ‘VIDEO’, and ‘WATCH’ appear frequently in fake news but do not in real news. From these two word clouds, we can get some important information to differentiate the two classes of data.
The original form of the dataset is two CSV files containing fake and real news respectively. We combined the dataset and split it into training, validation, and test sets with shuffling at the ratio of 64%:16%:20%. The original combined dataset contains 44,898 pieces of data, and Table 1. shows the distribution of data in the training, validation, and test sets.

###### Table 1. Distribution of Data
| Training | Validation | Test |
|:--------:|:----------:|:----:|
|    64%   |     16%    |  20% |
|   28734  |    7184    | 8980 |

## Data Preprocessing
The main goal of this part is to use NLP techniques to preprocess the input data and prepare for the next step to extract the proper features.  
	The data we use contains news titles and texts. Each of the titles is about 12.45 words long, while each of the texts is about 405.28 words long. In our project, we only use the titles for the fake news detection because the texts are too large for us to train efficiently. Also, the text contains too many details and information for a piece of news, which may distract the models during training.  
	We built a preprocessing pipeline for each statement to eliminate the noise in the fake news dataset. The preprocessing pipeline includes the following 3 sub-parts:
    
1. Replaced characters that are not between a to z or A to Z with whitespace.
2. Converted all characters into lower-case ones.
3. Removed the inflectional morphemes like “ed”, “est”, “s”, and “ing” from their token stem. Ex: confirmed → “confirm” + “ -ed”

We also cropped the titles into sentences with a maximum length of 42 in order to train the model on a dataset with sentences of reasonable lengths, and also eliminate titles with an extreme length that may let the model fit on unbalanced data.

## Word Embedding
This part is important because we need to convert the dataset into a form that models can handle. We use different types of word embedding for different models we built.  
	For LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM, and CNN, we first create a Tokenizer to tokenize The words and create sequences of tokenized words. Next, we zero-padded each sequence to make the length of it 42. Then, we utilized the Embedding layer that initialized with random weights to let it learn an embedding for all of the words in the training dataset. The Embedding layer [10] will convert the sequence into a distributed representation, which is a sequence of dense, real-valued vectors.

## Models
* **LSTM**  
Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) is an advanced version of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), which makes it easier to remember past data in memory. LSTM is a well-suited model for sequential data, such as data for NLP problems. Thus, we utilized LSTM to perform fake news detection.

* **Bidirectional LSTM**  
Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) [12] consists of two LSTMs: one taking the input from a forward direction, and the other in a backward direction. BiLSTM effectively increases the amount of information available to the network, improving the context available to the algorithm.

* **CNN-BiLSTM**  
In this section, we used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as the upper layer of the bidirectional LSTM. That is, the output of the CNN is the input of the BiLSTM. This architecture extracts the maximum number of features and information of the input text with convolutional layers, and also utilizes the bidirectional benefit of BiLSTM to ensure that the network can output based on its entire input text.

* **BERT**  
In the Natural Language Processing field, Transformers become more and more dominant. BERT [13], the acronym for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a transformer-based machine learning technique that changed the NLP world in recent years due to its state-of-the-art performance. Its two main features are that it is a deep transformer model so that it can process lengthy sentences effectively using the ‘attention’ mechanism, and it is bidirectional so that it will output based on the entire input sentence.  
We used BERT to handle the dataset and construct a deep learning model by fine-tuning the bert-based-uncased pre-trained model for fake news detection.
Training a model for natural language processing is costly and time-consuming because of the large number of parameters. Fortunately, we have pre-trained models of BERT that enable us to conduct transfer learning efficiently. We choose the pre-trained model of bert-base-uncased from a lot of models with different kinds of parameters. The chosen one consists of a base amount of parameters and does not consider cases of letters (upper-case and lower-case).

# Conclusions
In recent years, fake news detection plays an important role in national security and politics. In this paper, we covered the implementation of deep learning models (LSTM, BiLSTM, CNN-BiLSTM) and LSTM specifically for fake news detection on the ISOT Fake News dataset. We applied the balanced and imbalanced datasets with preprocessing and word embedding to get word sequences, and then input these sequences into our models achieving a test accuracy of 97.7%.
 
# Testing
We can test the model by putting the news titles and then they would be verifed by the trained model.
